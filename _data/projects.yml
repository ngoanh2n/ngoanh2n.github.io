  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I created this repository and developed as an owner. 
    This is built as a dependency with Java. 
    It’s able to compare 2 CSV files and assert the comparison result 
    that has differences, has additions, has modifications, has deletions between them.
